# LogaritmicFunctionPlot

A logarithmic function is a function of the form. which is read “ y equals the log of x, base b” or “ y equals the log, base b, of x.” In both forms, x > 0 and b > 0, b ≠ 1. 
For y=log(x) crescent function for base of log  > 1
with base 0<a<1 we have a graph of a descendent function
